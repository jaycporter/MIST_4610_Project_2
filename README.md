## Dataset Overview 
This dataset was obtained through the provided website (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset) and provides data regarding car accidents in New York from 2016 to 2022. The dataset itself is extremely extensive and contains thousands of rows and 30 columns. Each row in the dataset represents a different collision and each column is a different characteristic of the collision. For example, the location, time of day, date, leading cause of the collision, and the number of people injured are all included. For the purposes of our analysis, we focused on the following features: Borough, Collision ID, Contributing Factor, Crash Date, Crash Time, and Number of Persons Injured. 

The breakdown of the data types is as follows:

# Question 1

## Q1: Is there an increase in crashes depending on day and time of the week? If so, is it the same across all boroughs or specific ones? From this data, what time and location would give the highest probability of getting into a crash?

# Question 2

## Q2: Of the accidents recorded, what were the leading causes? How many people were injured due to these types of accidents? Is there a correlation between a certain cause of accident and time of day?

## Manipulations 
The main point of manipulation our team decided to perform on our dataset was to omit data we deemed unncessary. We did this by analyzing the overall data and deciding what was most relevant and what we wanted our questions to focus around. This mostly ended up being about the causes of collisions, and the trends of specific causes throughout a 24 hour period. By understanding what we wanted to answer, we were able to manipulate our dataset into one that displayed clear conditions. Without doing this, our dataset would be much larger and would carry more unncessary information that would make the purpose of our questions more difficult to understand. 

## Tableau Packaged Workbook 
The Tableau packaged workbook is attached to this repository. The visualizations are located on dashboards corresponding to their respective questions.
